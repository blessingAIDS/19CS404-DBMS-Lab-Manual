### Entities and Attributes

| Entity    | Attributes (PK, FK) | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| Member    | member_id (PK), name, gender, dob, email, membership_type, start_date | Represents gym members who register for programs. |
| Program   | program_id (PK), program_name, fee, duration, schedule | Represents the different fitness programs (e.g., Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training). |
| Trainer   | trainer_id (PK), trainer_name, trainer_gender, trainer_phone, trainer_email, expertise | Stores trainer information (e.g., contact details, expertise). |
| Session   | session_id (PK), date, time, trainer_id (FK), program_id (FK) | Represents individual time-bound classes. |
| Payment   | payment_id (PK), amount, payment_type, payment_date, member_id (FK), program_id (FK) | Records payments made by members for specific programs. |
| Attendance| attendance_id (PK), status, session_id (FK), member_id (FK) | Tracks attendance of members in specific sessions. |

### Relationships and Constraints

| Relationship | Cardinality | Participation | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| enrolls_in   | M:N | Member (Total), Program (Partial) | A member can enroll in multiple programs; a program can have many members. |
| leads        | 1:M | Program (Total), Trainer (Partial) | Each program is led by one trainer, but a trainer may lead multiple programs. |
| registers    | M:N | Both Partial | A member can register for many sessions, and each session can have many members. |
| includes     | 1:M | Program (Total), Session (Total) | A program includes multiple sessions, but each session belongs to only one program. |
| has          | 1:M | Member (Total), Payment (Total) | A member can make many payments; each payment belongs to one program. |
| attends      | 1:M | Session (Total), Attendance (Total) | A session can have multiple attendance records. |

### Assumptions
- A member must enroll in at least one program.
- A program must be led by at least one trainer.
- Payments are tied to members and programs (not to trainers directly).
- Attendance is tracked at the session level.
